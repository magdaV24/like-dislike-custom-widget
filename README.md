### A custom Wordpress widget for liking/disliking comments

The data is saved in the commentmeta table, in the MySQL database. The widget allows for the user to like or dislike a comment. It checks for a previos intercation and based on that, sends the data and saves it in the table. The frontend of the user will reflect wheter or not they interacted with the comments.
